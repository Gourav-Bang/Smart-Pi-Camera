# Smart-Pi-Camera
This project is based on Raspberry Pi, Computer Vision and Python.

# Introduction
In present day the commodity is in the form of security camera, surveillance system and home automation. In
this era security camera is limited to video recording and live streaming so in this project we are going to

escalate security camera by providing motion sensing, unauthorized detection and making conscious using e-
mail services, and app push notification.

Our pi camera brings you one stop solution consisting all features required for home security ensuring
protection and security at very effective cost.

# Technical Aspects
Following are the features of our pi camera –
1. Smart Motion detection, and real-time motion alert via email user by sending image
2. Face Recognition detecting known and unknown/or unauthorized entry.
3. Compatible with Home Automation, for locking doors in case of unknown face detected.
4. Alerts when smoke or other obstacles comes in between which reduces picture clarity and sensibility
adjustments with less false alarm
5. GSM Module for auto Dialing Police Emergency and User’s number and sending Text messages in case
of untheorized presence found.
6. GSM Module use its own data for internet connectivity and do not rely on Wi-fi.
7. Schedulable Motion Detection by setting certain time duration.
8. Dual Mode- Surveillance and Motion Detection Mode for different purposes.
9. Compatible with Smart Doors for locking in case of unknown face detected.
10. Cloud Storage for Recorded Video.
11. Live stream on your mobile phones
